## Component Details



Initial analysis of the deepface library, focusing on the detection module. Further analysis is needed to identify more components and their relationships across other modules like demography, modeling, and recognition. The current focus is on understanding the core functionalities within detection.py and how they contribute to the overall face analysis process. Future steps will involve analyzing other modules and establishing relationships between them to build a comprehensive understanding of the library's architecture and data flow. The 'referenced_source_code' for 'detect_faces' and 'extract_faces' is a placeholder as the exact line numbers are not yet known without the file content.
